Pizza bases are readily available in store, but its better to make from scratch. 

STEP1: Pizza Base:
Sift all purpose flour, add salt, baking powder, baking soda and oil. Give it a whisk and add water in small quantities.Once you add water, it will be more like crumbles. Add small amount water and knead it with hands. The Dough should not be sticky, it shouldn't stick to your fingers.
Yeast is optional.

Step 2: Tomato Puree/Pizza sauce:
Dice 4 tomato and peel of skin of onion and garlic. Add in blender and blend well. Add olive oil in hot pan followed by tomato puree, salt, oregano seasoning, freshly crushed pepper powder(add less powder for making it non-spicy or a bit spicy). Keep in simmer and let it sit for 10 mins, then add 1 Tbsp tomato sauce. Water is mostly evaporated, it begins to thicken. So that when applied coat will be evenly spread. If its watery it will not be even.

Step 3: Toppings:
Vertically cut capsicum and slit from top to bottom, 1/4 of capsicum with 4 buds at bottom. again cut vertically in finger sized wedges.
For tomato remove the seeds and cut it rectangular pieces, cube would be more decorable.
Slit the mushrooms from bottom to top. Handle carefully as they are soft. Add them in boiled water and let it sit for few mins like 5 - 7 mins and strain the extra water. Now we have a clean mushroom.
Toppings are all ready. You may add more veggies as per your needs.

Step 4: Hand Tossing:
Take out the tucked in dough, knead it little bit. Start hand tossing using a roller and stretch it with even thickness which is very important. Shape it up using circular plate and remove the excess. you can give any shape to it as it's homemade.

Step 5 Transfer to Bake Plate:
Apply oil coating on the plate and transfer the pizza dough into it, Poke it with fork for air vent.

Step 6: Time to Sauce the pizza base up and add the Toppings:
Apply pizza sauce and spread with butter knife nice and easy. In the mean time grate the mozzarella cheese in cheese grater.Add the grated cheese.Then Add the mushrooms and capsicums and all the toppings that you may have added.
Place them neatly as presentation matters. Then add the tomato cubes and apply mozzarella cheese on top of it.

Step 7: Bake:
Preheat the oven to 400 F, Bake it for 15 mins at the 400. If you want all over cheesy 12 mins should do.

Step 8: Serve:
Slice it using pizza cutter and add oregano and chilli flakes, just to add a special touch to it.
